\title{
Implements the icRSF algorithm to calculate variable importance
}
\description{
Implements a modification to the Random Survival Forests algorithm [1] for obtaining variable importance in high dimensional datasets. The proposed algorithm is appropriate for settings in which a silent event is observed through sequentially administered, error-prone self-reports or laboratory based diagnostic tests. The modified algorithm incorporates a formal likelihood framework that accommodates sequentially administered, error-prone self-reports or laboratory based diagnostic tests [2]. The original Random Survival Forests algorithm is modified by the introduction of a new splitting criterion based on a likelihood ratio test statistic [3].
